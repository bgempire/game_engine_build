# "Build Game" Addon for Blender 2.7x / UPBGE 0.2.x

Make your game ready for share in multiple platforms.

### Note from the author:
Your game is not a "substantial portion" of the Software.
The Simple Launcher is Public Domain
Blenderplayer is GPL 3, if you are going to use it, copy its License file.
Don't worry too much about how easily your game can be modified, the better
games are those who have mods and thousands of pirated copies.
